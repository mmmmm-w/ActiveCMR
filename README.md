# ActiveCMR Project

## Description

This project focuses on [**Describe the main goal, e.g., applying Active Learning techniques to Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) image analysis, possibly for segmentation, classification, etc.**]. It utilizes [mention specific methods or models if applicable] to improve [mention the specific improvement, e.g., data efficiency, model performance] in CMR tasks.


## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd ActiveCMR
    ```
2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is located in the `Dataset/` directory. It is also provided as a zip file `Dataset.zip`.

*   [**Add instructions here if the dataset needs specific preparation, e.g., unzipping, downloading from a source, pre-processing steps.**]
*   [**Describe the dataset structure or format if necessary.**]

## Usage

1.  **Experimentation:**
    *   The `playground.ipynb` notebook can be used for interactive testing, visualization, and exploring parts of the codebase. Ensure you have Jupyter installed (`pip install jupyter`).

2.  **Running Scripts:**
    *   The main functionalities like training, evaluation, or data processing are likely handled by scripts within the `scripts/` directory.
    *   [**Add specific commands here, e.g.:**]
        ```bash
        # Example: Run the training script
        python scripts/train.py --config <path_to_config> --data_dir Dataset/ --output_dir results/ --checkpoint_dir checkpoints/

        # Example: Run an evaluation script
        python scripts/evaluate.py --model_path checkpoints/<model_name>.pth --data_dir Dataset/
        ```
    *   [**Explain any necessary command-line arguments or configuration files.**]

## Results

*   Experimental results, logs, and generated outputs are typically saved in the `results/` directory.
*   [**Mention specific subdirectories or file naming conventions if applicable.**]

## Checkpoints

*   Trained model weights are saved in the `checkpoints/` directory. These can be used for inference or resuming training.

## Dependencies

All necessary Python packages are listed in `requirements.txt`.
